# Stocks-Analysis
## Overview
Steve is currently managing his parent's investment portfolio where they invested heavily into a single stock. Steve tasked us with creating a VBA script that can at a press of a button, analyze the stock's position compared to other stocks in the same industry. For this challenge, Steve tasked us with refactoring the code we originally made to see if we can make it run faster in case he wanted to re-use the code to run an analysis for thousands of stocks.

## Analysis and Findings


## Pros and Cons of refactoring Code
### Pros
 - Refactoring code allows you to set up a base structure that different functionallity can be built upon at a later date
 - Can save time by not having to re-input/define variables 
 
### Cons
 - After not returning to a code for a long period of time, it may appear confusing if it is messy, no comments in the whitespace, and weird overall structuring that may   cause problems for new people accessing the code and aswell for returining coders to their own work.
