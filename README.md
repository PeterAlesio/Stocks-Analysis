# Stocks-Analysis
## Overview
 Steve is currently managing his parent's investment portfolio where they invested heavily into a single stock. Steve tasked us with creating a VBA script that can at a press of a button, analyze the stock's position compared to other stocks in the same industry. For this challenge, Steve tasked us with refactoring the code we originally made to see if we can make it run faster in case he wanted to re-use the code to run an analysis for thousands of stocks.

## Analysis and Findings
 From looking at the analyses performed in 2017 and 2018, DQ performed excellently in 2017 with an almost 200% return. However, it suffered in 2018 by going down by 63%. the performance DQ experienced seems to be industry based as the other stocks had a similar trend of performing well in 2017 and performing negativly in 2018 with a few exceptions. It is also noteworthy to mention that DQ performed the best in 2017 while then performing the worst out of all the stocks in 2018. A reason for this could be  that DQ was overvalued in 2017 and thus recieved the largest correction in their valuation in the next year.

The 2017 program managed to run in 0.1875 seconds

![2018Analysis](https://github.com/PeterAlesio/Stocks-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA%20Challenge%202018.png)

The 2018 program managed to run in 0.15626 seconds which is slightly faster than the 2017 analysis.

## Pros and Cons of refactoring Code
### Pros
 - Refactoring code allows you to set up a base structure that different functionallity can be built upon at a later date
 - Can save time by not having to re-input/define variables 
 
### Cons
 - After not returning to a code for a long period of time, it may appear confusing if it is messy, no comments in the whitespace, and weird overall structuring that may   cause problems for new people accessing the code and aswell for returining coders to their own work.
